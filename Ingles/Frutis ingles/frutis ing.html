                    <h6>BRIEF</h6>
                    <p>This project was carried out from the "Service Design Challenge 2022" contest, where it was requested to design a service of any type, as long as it was conscious, responsible and the collaborative consumption was taken into account, in addition to the redefinition of the concept of property through the circular economy.

                    It is worth mentioning that this service design was taken as the thesis project for getting the bachelor's degree.

                  <br><br>Subsequently, we began the planning and implementation of quantitative and qualitative research in the Central de Abasto to understand the motivations and needs of the actors or people involved in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. 12 vendors were interviewed within the Central de Abasto and 33 consumers from Mexico City were surveyed through Google Forms, in addition a guerrilla investigation of the vendors of the Central was carried out.

                  <p>There are 4 essential actors in the management, distribution and consumption within the Central de Abasto:

                  <br><br><strong>• Wholesalers:</strong> They sell the product in large quantities and do not have much variety
                  <br><br><strong>• Retailers:</strong> They sell the product in small quantities and in variety
                  <br><br><strong>• Consumers:</strong> Internal food vendors or external people who buy products at the Central de Abasto
                  <br><br><strong>• Diableros:</strong> They help the internal transport of product

                  <h6>RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h6>
                  <p>As a result of the first 3 phases of the project, a small company called Frutis was created, which collects and sells fruits and vegetables that due to their aesthetics, size or surplus are discarded within the Central de Abasto.
                  
                    <div>
                      <h8>How does it work</h8>
                      <p>Through the collection of the aforementioned product with the help of diableros who are dedicated to collecting it and bringing it to our vendor trucks located in the loading and unloading area within the Central for subsequent sale.
                      </p>

                      <h8>Paradigm shift</h8>
                      <p><em><strong>How can we create a true paradigm shift focused on a conscious and circular economy?</em></strong> It is not only worrying about the correct use of fruits and vegetables, but also about people and creating a connection in which everyone feels proud of their work to the point that it is recognized and valued by outsiders, thus creating a healthy interaction between consumer-workers-product.
